#My portfolio website

##What is the purpose of this?
This website is a mini project assignment by Udacity where I am given a mock-up (this time a website showcasing my portfolio). I had to code it from scratch using a css-framwework provided by Udacity. No bootstrap allowed -- yet. 

##How you can begin to use this project?
Simply download the files (within the same directory), open index.html.
