Entertainment-center.py, media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py build a movie website with all of my favorite movies. If you click on any one of them, its trailer will play. 

No installation is required, other than having Python on your computer. Simply download the files (within the same directory), open entertainment-center.py and run the program.
