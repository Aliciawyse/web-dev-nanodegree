# Movie Trailer Website

##What does this project do?
All together, entertainment-center.py, media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py build a movie website with all of my favorite movies. If you click on any one of them, its trailer will play. 

In media.py the class Movie is defined. In entertainment-center.py, multiple instances of the class Movie are created. Fresh_tomatoes.py is code provided by Udacity that creates a webpage where you can view your favorite movies; if you click on any of these movies you can view its trailer. 

##How you can begin to use this project?
You will need Python 2 to run this code. Simply download the files (within the same directory), open entertainment-center.py and run the program.
